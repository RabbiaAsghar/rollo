* the humanot is connecting to the network again, ip address 130.251.13.142, port 900
* attempts to connect to send raw udp messages to the Humanot

* started working on the motive, translation of tracked coordinates into euler coordinates
* Motive data on the host: position in millimeters X, Y, Z (Z calibrated to point towards us) 
* Motive data on the host: orientation in degrees Pitch X, Yaw Y, Roll Z 
* Motive data on the client: position in millimeters X, Y, Z (Z calibrated to point towards us)
* Motive data on the clinet: orientation in degrees Pitch X, Yaw Y, Roll Z 
* Rollo pose, ground_pose logging
* used python to convert from quaternion coordinates to euler, input needs to be a matrix, output in radians
* started writing subscriber/publisher for Rollo
